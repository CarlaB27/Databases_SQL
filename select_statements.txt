1. Write out a generic SELECT statement.

SELECT <column>
FROM <table>
WHERE <some condition exist>

eg. SELECT name 
FROM animals
WHERE age > 5;

2. Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.
SELECT - Shots
FROM - for
WHERE - What

3. Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:
Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column may have multiple words (for example, "Labrador Collie mix").

Q: Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.

SELECT name, age, gender
FROM dogs
WHERE breed LIKE %Labrador% ;

Q: Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.

SELECT id
FROM dogs
WHERE age < 1;

Q: Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.

SELECT name, age
FROM dogs
WHERE gender='F' AND weight > 35;

Q: Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.

SELECT *
FROM dogs
WHERE breed NOT LIKE %Shepherd%

Q: Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.

SELECT id, age, weight, breed
FROM dogs
WHERE weight > 60 OR breed LIKE %Great Dane%

4. Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?

Q: SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;

name	    adoption_date
Mushi	    22/03/2016 00:00:00
Seashell	
Azul	    17/04/2016 00:00:00
Victoire	01/09/2016 00:00:00
Nala	

Q: SELECT name, age FROM cats;

name	    age
Mushi	    1
Seashell	7
Azul	    3
Victoire	7
Nala	    1

5. From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.
    
Q: Display all the information about all of the available cats.

SELECT * FROM cats WHERE adoption_date is NULL;
id	name	    gender	age	intake_date	adoption_date
2	Seashell	F	    7	09/01/2016  00:00:00	
5	Nala	    F	    1	12/01/2016  00:00:00	

Q: Display the name and sex of all cats who are 7 years old.

SELECT name, gender FROM cats WHERE age=7;
name	    gender
Seashell	F
Victoire	M

Q: Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.

SELECT name FROM cats;

Seashell
Azul
Victoire
Nala

6. List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.
If you can’t list these from memory, do these flashcards until you can!
< Less than. Terrible temperature < 70.
> Greater than. Good temperature is > 70.
<= Less than or equal to. Test score for grade of fail <= 60.
>= Greater than or equal to. Test score for grade of A >= 90.
!= not equal to. Where year != 2019.
= equal to. Where year = 2019.

7. From the cats table, what data is returned from these queries?

Q: SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = ‘F’;

Nala

Q: SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age <> 3;
name
Mushi
Seashell
Victoire
Nala

Q:  SELECT ID FROM cats WHERE name != ‘Mushi’ AND gender = ‘M’;
